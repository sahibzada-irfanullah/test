I am a research group leader at ETH Zurich and co-founder of [Elevate3D](https://elevate3d.ai/). 

I received my Ph.D. degree from Link√∂ping University, Sweden in 2018. My thesis "Visual Tracking" was awarded the biennial Best Nordic Thesis Prize. My main research interests are 3D visualization, temporal perception, deep probabilistic models, and generative methods. My research includes applications to video tracking and segmentation, dense correspondence estimation, super-resolution, and much more.
